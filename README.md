### Contribute
If you would like to contribute to one of our existing repositories, you can [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks "learn about GitHub forks") the repository, make any changes/improvements, then submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests "learn to issue pull requests") to have your forked repo merged.
If you are wanting to create a new repository however, you will need to be an active member of the **CQU Repository** organization

### Join the team
This organisation is a student collaboration project run **'by the students, for the students'**, however you can also [request an invite to join](mailto:cqu.repository@gmail.com?subject=GitHub%20organization%20join%20request "Request an invite") or come [chat with us on discord](https://discord.gg/zfZMK3U "Join our discord server")

Don't be offended if we ask questions to confirm you are a current (or past) CQUniversity IT student, our code will be made public for everyone to consume, but direct access to anything beyond public repositories is limited to students past and present only
